# open_the_door

SIM and Wifi connected door opener with stepper motor on NodeMCU.
This project tries to solve a simple problem: making a key was too expensive and was also illegal since we lost the security card of that particular key.

To do so, we use a NodeMCU board that is connected to a stepper motor.
To ensure the communication between the NodeMCU and the outside, I wrote a simple protocol that offers the possibility to fully control the motor and check status of the captors.

## Schematics of the entire project

## Protocol

## In action
// TODO here put photos and videos of the final project

## 3D Model


## TODO FOR THE MOTOR

- Make the top gear/wheel for the rope
- Change the number of steps to the exact one
- Don't put the motor on pin2 it is reserved for the second LED

Important note: Manufacturers usually specify that the motors have a 64:1 gear reduction. Some members of the Arduino Forums noticed that this wasnâ€™t correct and so they took some motors apart to check the actual gear ratio. They determined that the exact gear ratio is in fact 63.68395:1, which results in approximately 4076 steps per full revolution (in half step mode).

In the setup, you can set the speed in rpm with the function setSpeed(rpm). The maximum speed for a 28byj-48 stepper motor is roughly 10-15 rpm at 5 V.

## Commands I use to communicate with the SIM card

Command to enter communication mode with the SIM800L :
```sudo minicom -b 115000 -o -D /dev/serial0```

``` 
> AT+CPIN?
< +CPIN: READY
<
< OK

> AT+CMFG?
< +CMFG: 0
< 
< OK

> AT+CMGF=1
< OK

To send a SMS you can use the command below and terminate it with a CTRL+Z :

> AT+CMGS="+33601020304"
> Hello World!
< +CMGS: 1
<
< OK
```
